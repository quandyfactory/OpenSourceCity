# Open Source City

## Introduction

Municipal governance is conducted mainly behind the scenes by politicians and city staffers working outside the public eye, with severely limited access to both public data and opportunities for public participation in forming and evaluating policy.

The Open Source City concept aims to change that through a combination of new technologies and processes to put municipal governance into the hands of residents:

1. A public Application Programming Interface (API) for accessing publicly available municipal data, including a platform on which citizens can collaborate on building reports and analyses.

2. A culture of openness, transparency, accountability and tolerance for *found errors* in City Hall that celebrates public oversight and views problems not as faults to be punished but as important and valuable opportunities to improve the end product.

3. A new policy consulting process that emphasizes widespread public brainstorming, innovation and debate starting at the earliest stages of policy development, rather than forming policies in-house or by paid private consultants and only making them available at public information sessions after the major policy development phase is already complete.

## Public Data API

The open API concept is about more than just making reports easier to find. It's about: making public city data easier to access, including programmatically; opening the city's business up to public analysis; encouraging collaboration among residents to fix processes, develop enhancements and promote new initiatives; and fostering networking among Hamilton programmers and application developers.

All publicly available city data should have the following characteristics:

1. It should be complete - all public data should be available.
2. It should be consist principally of low-level data rather than a high-level summary.
3. It should be made available in a timely fashion.
4. It should be non-proprietary but rather clearly and unambiguously in the public domain.
5. It should be both findable and accessible to anyone at any time.
6. It should be stored in a format that is both machine- and human-readable.
7. It should be combinable with other public data. 
8. It should provide a platform on which third parties can build innovative tools and add-ons.

## Culture of Openness

Moving to a culture of openness is a scary proposition for municipal staffers. It means pushing the city's internal operations into open data management and workflow management systems that are better tailored to sharing and collaboration than the current hodgepodge of closed, proprietary, black-box systems. 

It also means exposing the city to much closer oversight, including potentially identifying wasteful processes that currently pass unchallenged because either a) no one has time to notice them or b) the people who know about them don't have the power or inclination to fix them.

Staff members may feel that either their job security or professional reptations may be at risk in such an environment. As a result, the change to a culture of openness should follow at least four main guidelines:

1. Make Staff Jobs Easier - an open data system should make it easier for staffers to get necessary information in an accessible format and perform work that adds real value.

2. No Job Loss Through Redundancy - No one's job should be threatened with redundancy. Instead, it should allow staffers to do the kind of analysis that machines can't replicate, redeploying city resources where they can work most effectively at solving problems.

3. Iterative Development - the transformation to an open data model should be iterative and incremental, not sweeping. As John Gall famously stated, "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work."

4. Celebrate Errors - The prevailing corporate (and public) culture would have to change from one that punishes errors (and hence drives them underground) to one that celebrates openness and sees problems not as faults to be punished but as important and valuable opportunities to improve the end product.

    Under today's system, no one wants to look bad so people spend too much time data hoarding and CYA and not enough time finding and fixing problems. As a result, yet more time is wasted trying to obtain and manipulate information to produce reports that are, in turn, also hard to find and manipulate.

## New Policy Consulting Process

Right now, policy consulting is conducted in an "ivory tower" model: closed, top-down and based on private expertise. An ivory tower approach vests development in the hands of professionals whose skills are proprietary (and hence closed to third party scrutiny) and whose expertise lies in developing a product that is not released publicly until it is completed, after which the public opportunities for feedback are severely limited.

Open policy consulting, by contrast, is bottom-up: community-led, contributing and evaluating a much wider array of possible ideas, and engaging the public at the very earliest stages of development.

The expertise in an open consulting model lies not in developing the product itself, which is best done via community engagement, but in fostering the *collaboration* that makes community development possible. Under this approach, many contributors put forward enhancements and fixes, and the project managers decide, based on community feedback, which additions to pursue in more detail.

## Next Steps

All three open source city initiatives are in only the very earliest planning stages. The next steps will include at a minimum:

1. Studying other cities that have attempted to implement some or all of these initiatives to discover object lessons and develop/compile best practices. 

2. Setting up or facilitating an open data API and other related technologies, and finding ways to encourage community participation.

3. Persuading the city to try out open source city concepts and test various models in real use, adapting strategies and processes in response to observation and feedback.

4. Looking into organizational structures and funding models for these initiatives.
